-- ^ DSL for constructing witnesses in an arithmetic circuit. @a@ is a base
-- field; @x@ is a "field of witnesses over @a@" which you can safely assume to
-- be identical to @a@ with internalized equality.

type Witness i a = forall x . WitnessField a x => (i -> x) -> x
-- ^ A type of witness builders. @i@ is a type of variables, @a@ is a base field.
--
-- A function is a witness builer if, given an arbitrary field of witnesses @x@
-- over @a@ and a function mapping known variables to their witnesses, it computes
-- the new witness in @x@.
--
-- NOTE: the property above is correct by construction for each function of a
-- suitable type, you don't have to check it yourself.

type NewConstraint i a = forall x . Algebra a x => (i -> x) -> i -> x
-- ^ A type of constraints for new variables. @i@ is a type of variables, @a@ is a base field.
--
-- A function is a constraint for a new variable if, given an arbitrary algebra
-- @x@ over @a@, a function mapping known variables to their witnesses in that
-- algebra and a new variable, it computes the value of a constraint polynomial
-- in that algebra.
--
-- NOTE: the property above is correct by construction for each function of a
-- suitable type, you don't have to check it yourself.

type ClosedPoly i a = forall x . Algebra a x => (i -> x) -> x
-- ^ A type of polynomial expressions. @i@ is a type of variables, @a@ is a base field.
--
-- A function is a polynomial expression if, given an arbitrary algebra @x@ over
-- @a@ and a function mapping known variables to their witnesses, it computes a
-- new value in that algebra.

    -- ^ DSL for constructing arithmetic circuits. @i@ is a type of variables,
    -- @a@ is a base field and @m@ is a monad for constructing the circuit.
    --
    -- DSL provides the following guarantees:
    -- * There are no unconstrained variables;
    -- * Variables with equal constraints and witnesses are reused as much as possible;
    -- * Variables with either different constraints or different witnesses are different;
    -- * There is an order in which witnesses can be generated;
    -- * Constraints never reference undefined variables.
    --
    -- However, DSL does NOT provide the following guarantees (yet):
    -- * That provided witnesses satisfy the provided constraints. To check this,
    --   you can use 'ZkFold.Symbolic.Compiler.ArithmeticCircuit.checkCircuit'.
    -- * That introduced polynomial constraints are supported by the zk-SNARK
    --   utilized for later proving.
